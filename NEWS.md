# skedastic 0.1.0

This is the first release of the package.

# skedastic 1.0.4

Version 1.0.0 of the package included some additional heteroskedasticity test functions. Subsequent versions up to 1.0.4 involve very tiny changes. For instance, versions 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 were changed only to remove dependencies on other R packages that were scheduled for archiving by CRAN.
