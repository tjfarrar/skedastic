\title{Probability mass function of number of peaks in a random series}
\usage{
dpeak(n, k, usedata = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer representing the number of observations in the
series.}

\item{k}{An integer or a sequence of integers strictly incrementing by 1,
with all values between 0 and \code{n - 1} inclusive. Represents the number
of peaks in the series.}

\item{usedata}{A logical. Should probability mass function values be
read from \code{\link{dpeakdat}} rather than computing them? This option
will save significantly on computation time if \eqn{n < 170} but is
currently only available for \eqn{n \leq 1000}.}
}
\value{
A double between 0 and 1 representing the probability of exactly
k peaks occurring in a series of \eqn{n} independent and identically
distributed continuous random variables. Computation time is very slow for
\eqn{n > 170} (if \code{usedata} is \code{FALSE}) and for \eqn{n > 1000}
regardless of \code{usedata} value.
}
\description{
This function computes \eqn{P(n,k)} as defined by
\insertCite{Goldfeld65;textual}{skedastic}, i.e. the probability that a
series of \eqn{n} independent and identically distributed random variables
contains exactly \eqn{k} peaks, with peaks also as defined by
\insertCite{Goldfeld65;textual}{skedastic}. The function is used in
\code{\link{ppeak}} to compute \eqn{p}-values for the Goldfeld-Quandt
nonparametric test for heteroskedasticity in a linear model.
